This operator, 'dissection', turns a container-like functor into a bifunctor representing a one-hole context in which elements to the left of the hole are distinguished in type from elements to its right.},

@unpublished{carette_species,
	title = {Species: making analytic functors practical for functional programming},
	abstract = {Inspired by Joyals theory of species, we show how to add new type constructors and constructor combinators
to the tool set of functional languages. We show that all the important properties of inductive types lift
to this new setting. Species are analytic functors, representing a broader range of structures than regular
functors. This includes structures such as bags, cycles and graphs. The theory is greatly inspired by
combinatorics rather than type theory: this adds interesting new tools to bear, but also requires more
work on our part to show that species form a good foundations for a theory of type constructors. The
combinatorial tools provide a calculus for these structures which has strong links with classical analysis,
via a functorial interpretation of generating series. Furthermore, we show how generic programming idioms
also generalise to this richer setting. Once the theory is understood, various methods of implementation are
relatively straightforward.},

We then present a generic decision procedure for Epigram’s in-built equality at each type, taking a complementary approach to that of Benke, Dybjer and Jansson [7]. We also give a generic definition of map, taking our inspiration from Jansson and Jeuring [21]. Finally, we equip the regular universe with the partial derivative which can be interpreted functionally as Huet’s notion of ‘zipper’, as suggested by McBride in [27] and implemented (without the fixpoint case) in Generic Haskell by Hinze, Jeuring and Löh [18]. We aim to show through these examples that generic programming can be ordinary programming in a dependently typed language.},

  function equations, counting sequences, and random generation algorithms can
  be compiled from specifications. Asymptotic properties can be determined
  automatically for a reasonably large subclass. Maple libraries that implement
  such decision procedures are briefly surveyed (LUO, combstruct, equivalent).
  In addition, libraries for manipulating holonomic sequences and functions are
  presented (gfun, Mgfun).},

      one can use this style of reasoning to \emph{calculate} programs, in

      algebras, constructors, and values; dual \emph{co-algebraic} methods

      methods are elegant and powerful; they deserve to be combined. }

  Some type class instances can be automatically derived from the
  structure of types. As a result, the Haskell language includes the
  "deriving" mechanism to automatic generates such instances for a
  small number of built-in type classes. In this paper, we present
  RepLib, a GHC library that enables a similar mechanism for arbitrary
  type classes. Users of RepLib can define the relationship between
  the structure of a datatype and the associated instance declaration
  by a normal Haskell functions that pattern-matches a representation
  types. Furthermore, operations defined in this manner are
  extensible---instances for specific types not defined by type
  structure may also be incorporated. Finally, this library also
  supports the definition of operations defined by parameterized
  types.

  abstract =     {   
  Polytypic programming is a way of defining type-indexed
  operations, such as map, fold and zip, based on type information.
  Run-time polytypic programming allows that type information to
  be dynamically computed---this support is essential in modern
  programming languages that support separate compilation, first-class
  type abstraction, or polymorphic recursion.
  
  However, in previous work we defined run-time polytypic programming
  with a type-passing semantics. Although it is natural to define
  polytypic programs as operating over first-class types, such a
  semantics suffers from a number of drawbacks. This paper describes
  how to recast that work in a type-erasure semantics, where terms
  represent type information in a safe manner.  The resulting language
  is simple and easy to implement---we present a prototype
  implementation of the necessary machinery as a small Haskell
  library.

abstract="{Summary: The process some call `categorification' consists of
    interpreting set-theoretic structures in mathematics as derived from
    category-theoretic structures. Examples include the interpretation of $\Bbb
    N$ as the Burnside rig of the category of finite sets with product and
    coproduct, and of $\Bbb N[x]$ in terms the category of combinatorial
    species. This has interesting applications to quantum mechanics, and in
    particular the quantum harmonic oscillator, via Joyal's `combinatorial
    species', and a new generalization called `stuff types' described by Baez
    and Dolan, which are a special case of Kelly's `clubs'. Operators between
    stuff types be represented as rudimentary Feynman diagrams for the
    oscillator. In quantum mechanics, we want to represent states in an algebra
    over the complex numbers, and also want our Feynman diagrams to carry more
    structure than these `stuff operators' can do, and these turn out to be
    closely related. We will describe a categorification of the quantum harmonic
    oscillator in which the group of `phases' - that is, $U(1)$, the circle
    group - plays a special role. We describe a general notion of `$M$-stuff
    types' for any monoid $M$, and see that the case $M=U(1)$ provides an
    interpretation of time evolution in the combinatorial setting, as well as
    recovering the usual Feynman rules for the quantum harmonic oscillator.}",

An operation of substitution for generalised species, which is the counterpart to the composition of generalised analytic functors, is also put forward. These definitions encompass most notions of combinatorial species considered in the literature  including of course Joyal's original notion  together with their associated substitution operation. Our first main result exhibits the substitution calculus of generalised species as arising from a Kleisli bicategory for a pseudo-comonad on profunctors. Our second main result establishes that the bicategory of generalised species of structures is cartesian closed.
