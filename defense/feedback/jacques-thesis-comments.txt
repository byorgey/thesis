[The page numbers are all on the official version sent in to the examiners]

Note: I will use 'bb' to indicate 'bad break' below.

General comments:
- please review all your uses of "trivial", "trivially", "not hard",
"easy", "easily", and so on.  First, there are too many.  Second, some
of them are only 'easy' after proper understanding, but not so in the
middle of introducing the concept.
(ex: p.43)
- section 2.2.2 (p.48).  This material feels really important to me --
raise its profile, somehow?
- I definitely think that 3.1-3.5 should be one chapter, 3.6-3.11 another.

Chapter 0.
- p.1 you use the word "container" which might lead to more confusion
than help?
- p.2 the use of 'treeProd' maybe assumes too much reader knowledge?
- p.3 Carette and Uszkay reference not in bib
- p.3 "[Duchon et al., 2002, Philippe Duchon and Chaeffer," - malformed
bib ref
- p.4 normally DAG, not dag.
- p.4 "involv-ing" -- bad break.  You should review all your word
breaks, I have seen a dozen awful ones.
- p.4 nontermination or non-termination?
- p.5 "itself related issues", missing 'to'

Chapter 1.
- p.8 use of judgmental before definition
- p.9 axiomatic bb
- p.11 you talk about x =_A y, then equality of A and B, which is
confusing.  Stick to x and y, OR make it clear you have "moved up a
level" by talking of type equality instead of element equality.
- p.16 first full paragraph.  Is this used in the thesis?  If not, say
so, if it is, say where.
- p.16 "there constructively exists an A such that B" - I think you mean
"an a in A" ?  Or maybe "there constructively exists an inhabitant of A
such that B" ?
- p.21 "The above definition".  I would add (1.4.1) to be even more precise.
- p. 22 "categories nLab [2014c]" - the reference reads badly, format it
differently?
- p. 23 "replace by category", missing 'a'
- p.23 you refer to MacLane twice on this page, one reference to VII.2
has not \section symbol, the one to VII.7 does.  Be consistent!
[Throughout the thesis]
- p.24 cut definition 1.4.6 after the first sentence.  The rest is
commentary, not definition.
- p.24 give a reference/citation at the end of the commentary?
- p.26 top: "Remark. Note that" - a bit too much redundancy...

Chapter 2
- p. 32 "this can be seen as one of the goals of the univalent
foundations program" - I am not sure they would see it that way!
- p. 33 When talking about AC, it is always better to differentiate
finite AC, countable AC and 'larger' AC.
- p. 33 (around distributivity discussion) shouldn't you mention
Skolemization here?
- p. 33 ex-ercize bb
- p. 38 cat-egory bb
- p.44 defin-ing bb
- p.47 "2.2.1 Monoidal categories in HoTT\\ The first example is the
theory of monoidal categories."  I had to read this twice - if this is a
section on monoidal categories, why are they the first example?
- p.52 proof of 2.4.3.  It is worth looking at NAD's Agda proof of this
lemma.  And this proof is also in Joyal 81.
- p.53 remark on remark: in reversible computation, the 'computational
content' of this lemma appears to be crucial.
- p.57 A lot of 2.4.3 has its genesis in our early Haskell experiments -
is that worth a mention?
- p.60 I think the very last paragraph on that page (about building a
very specific functor) is quite important, and its profile should be raised.

Chapter 3
- p.65 Figure 3.8, that there are no labels (shape vs species) is
confusing on first read
- p.66 end of 3.1.  Interestingly the discussion here brought to mind
the "environment map + memory map" distinction that Dowek uses in
describing the semantics of Java in /Principles of Programming
Languages/, Springer UTiCS, ISBN: 978-1-8482-031-9.
- p. 70 I would have expected \mathcal{SPE} rather than bold in 3.2.3.
- p.72 F-form seems highly related to clique, yet there seems to be no
mention of this
- p.90 "objects, functors and natural transformations" occur twice in
the same sentence, which is awkward.
- p.90 using superscripts for functor categories, and also for lifting a
functor (3.6.9) confused me.  There has to be a less overloaded notation!
- p.93 I think you need the 'theory of sketches' by Barr & Wells for
lemma 3.6.12.
- p.94 I would call 3.7 "Partitional Product and Day Convolution"
- p.95 prod-ucts bb
- p.104 Example.  "E.E is the species of binary partitions, whereas E.E
is the species of subsets".  Uh??
- p. 107 Do you mean "(Fin m)!" or "(Fin m!)" ?
- p. 108 "for some particular choice of monoid in B" - don't you mean P
here?
- p.115 "rections" ?
- p.115 "Joyal [1981, p.-11]" bb
- p.115 "defintion" missing i
- p.117 there has to be a better explanation to why we these adjoints
exist for B !  Ask a category theorist?
- p.118 "and (\frak{C}, \times) has to be monoidal" reads funny.  Of
course it is monoidal, you just gave me the multiplication...  yet I
know what you mean, it was just surprising.
- p. 120 Fig-ure bb
- p.121 consist-ing bb
- p.121 prod-uct bb
- p.122 "derivative twice results in two different, distinguishable
holes" screams for a picture!
- p.123 Figure 3.43 is awkwardly placed
- p.123 The equation for the well-scoped terms of the (untyped) lambda
calculus is a Riccati equation!!!
- p.124 Are you sure that what Lescanne does is the same as this? It is
related, definitely, but there are important differences in the details
of the counting which might make the two approaches quite different.
- p. 125 "disucssion"
- p.129 "K \u+ L" would be much clearer as "L \u+ K" !
- p.129 [This definition of derivative is exceedingly cool!  In the
world of virtual species, this could give a nice interpretation to both
negative derivative (aka integration) and fractional derivatives too]
- p.130 Remind the reader that the rhs of the defining equation for (G
=>_{\dot} H) L has to be a set ?
- p.131 you should explicitly comment on L=>C species here.
- p.139 molec-ular bb
- p.140 char-acterized bb
- p.141 thm 3.13.1 should really refer to Joyal, not just 'the book'

Chapter 4
- p. 145 the "." after 4.5 is really hard to see, which makes the
sentence confusing (it could be a comma)
- p. 146 "which correspond to Cartesian closure" - missing 'the'
- p. 148 one equation has bold E, the other has blackboard E
- p. 148 X, Y but blackboard Z ????
- p.149 "S-sorted" instead of "S-sort" ?
- p.152 cat-egories bb
- p.159 "foregoing"  -> do you mean "that we will now introduce" or what
was in the previous section? [I know what "foregoing" means, not sure if
that's what you want to say]
- p.160 Perfom-ing bb
- p.160-161.  I hate 5-tuples (4 or more, really).  Amazingly hard to read.
- p.162 "i.e. a So," ????
- p. 164 At the end of 4.6, you really should summarize what all this
implies!  I mean, we don't remember what all the assumptions are, so
what kind of operations are supported on these species? spell it out.

Chapter 5
- p. 167 in defn 5.1.1 "functor K:E -> D, written ..." ?
- p. 167 don't put a footnote in a formula, it looks too much like a
superscript!
- p. 167 defin 5.1.1, put the type annotation on G ?
- p.167 put G in the commutative diagram?  And the Kan extension as a
2-arrow too?
- p.169 [??] reference
- p.169 "latter definition is less useful" insert 'immediately' between
less and useful?  To be useful, one really needs the full classification
theorem for analytic functors (i.e. for molecular decomposition)
- p.171 last formula: I would put A^n \times F n first, then ~= what you
have
- p.172 use ~~~ rather than = for the informal equality?
- p.173 Cat-egories bb
- p.174 (X and Y have no upper bound) -> insert 'necessarily'
- p.175 last line of 5.2: you have used E.E, not E^2, up to now for the
subsets species
- p.176 oper-ations bb
- p. 177 C is copowered over Set -- why Set?
- p. 177 you have bold B where you mean script B (near end of page)
- p. 179 Thus, \inject L ... missing (
- p. 179 remark: isn't this immediately related to separation logic?

Chapter 6
- p.180 grat-ifying bb

Bibl
- p. 184 (for example).  Some references are "N. Fiore, N. Gambino" etc,
while others "Philippe Flajolet, Bruno Salvy, " etc.  Actually, for two
of the Flajolet-Salvy, you mix styles!  Pick one.
- p. 186 Capitalization on Knuth's ACP
