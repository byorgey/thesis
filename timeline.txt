Outline
=======

+ Chapter 1: Introduction/preliminaries

  - Homotopy type theory.
  - Category theory.
  - Functor categories.
  - Groupoids.
  - Finiteness.
  - Parametricity.
  - Monoids and monoidal categories.

+ Chapter 2: Species

  - Traditional definition of species.
  - Restart "from scratch": functor categories.  Along the way,
    explain what extra structure is needed for each new feature, and
    give examples of categories we care about with those properties.
  - Lifting monoidal structure from codomain
    - Coproduct
    - Cartesian/Hadamard product
  - Day convolution.
  - Lifting monoidal structure from domain (via Day convolution)
    - partitional/Cauchy product
    - arithmetic product
  - Composition

+ Chapter 3: Labelled structures

  - Joyal's definition of analytic functors.
  - Labelled structures
  - Operations on labelled structures, lifted from operations on
    species.
  - Abstracting over "storage exponentials".
    - Functions
    - Vectors
    - Tries

+ Chapter 4: Applications

  - Generic functions (map, partition, filter, etc.)
  - A theory of matrix operations and allocation
  - ?

There is also a half-started chapter on computational interpretation
of generating functions which I'm quite excited about, but at this
point I think it's probably best to leave it out of the dissertation,
and work it out/write it up at some point in the future.

Timeline
========

Here's a proposed timeline for me to graduate in August.  I don't know
how realistic this is but I will sure try my best.  Feedback welcome.
Note in particular this does not include revising/writing/submitting
any papers; we should talk more about whether/when/where that might
happen.

March 18--28 (2 weeks): write (most of) Chapter 2
March 28--April 5 (1 week): Brent in London & Leipzig
April 7--18 (2 weeks): write Chapter 3
April 21--May 16 (4 weeks): work out chapter 4 material
May 19--30 (2 weeks): write Chapter 4
June (4 weeks): write Chapter 1 / miscellaneous / account for inevitable schedule slippage
Early July: defend (deadline is July 21)
Rest of July: revise (deadline for deposit is July 28)
