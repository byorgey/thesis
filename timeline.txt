Outline
=======

+ Chapter 0: Introduction + related work

  - Motivation
  - Summary of contributions

+ Chapter 1: preliminaries

  - Homotopy type theory.
  - Category theory.
  - Functor categories.
  - Groupoids.
  - Finiteness.
  - Parametricity.
  - Monoids and monoidal categories.

+ Chapter 2: Species
  CONTRIBUTIONS:
    - Generic categorical framework for species and generalizations thereof
    - with a target audience of type theorists/functional programmers
         novel parts: new audience, new gathering of material,
         once material is in once place, new connections
         (hopefully) see variants as instances of general framework
         new instantiation in type theory

  - Traditional definition of species.
  - Restart "from scratch": functor categories.  Along the way,
    explain what extra structure is needed for each new feature, and
    give examples of categories we care about with those properties.
  - Lifting monoidal structure from codomain
    - Coproduct
    - Cartesian/Hadamard product
  - Day convolution.
  - Lifting monoidal structure from domain (via Day convolution)
    - partitional/Cauchy product
    - arithmetic product
  - Composition
  - Differentiation + Pointing
  - multisort species
  - weighted species
  - L-species

  - Think about how to incorporate material on elimination etc.?

+ Chapter 3: Labelled structures
  CONTRIBUTIONS:
    - new idea of a labelled structure

  - Joyal's definition of analytic functors.
  - Labelled structures
  - Operations on labelled structures, lifted from operations on
    species.
  - Abstracting over "storage exponentials".
    - Functions
    - Vectors
    - Tries

+ Chapter 4: Applications

  - Generic functions (map, partition, filter, etc.)
  - A theory of matrix operations and allocation
  - ?

There is also a half-started chapter on computational interpretation
of generating functions which I'm quite excited about, but at this
point I think it's probably best to leave it out of the dissertation,
and work it out/write it up at some point in the future.

Timeline
========

Here's a proposed timeline for me to graduate in August.  I don't know
how realistic this is but I will sure try my best.  Feedback welcome.
Note in particular this does not include revising/writing/submitting
any papers; we should talk more about whether/when/where that might
happen.

March 18--28 (2 weeks): write (most of) Chapter 2
March 28--April 5 (1 week): Brent in London & Leipzig
April 7--11: put together MFPS paper
April 14--18: incorporate MFPS paper back into Chapter 2 and finish
April 21--May 2 (2 weeks): write Chapter 3
  - Sometime in here: get some feedback from committee
May (4 weeks): work out chapter 4 material
June (4 weeks): write chapter 4, and turn material from Chapters 2 & 3 into a POPL submission?
July (4 weeks): write Chapter 1 / miscellaneous / account for inevitable schedule slippage

October?: defend
