\chapter{Labelled structures}
\label{chap:labelled}

Now that we have a foundation for describing labelled shapes, the next
step is to extend them into full-blown \emph{data structures} by
adjoining mappings from labels to data.  For example,
\pref{fig:shape-data} illustrates an example of a labelled shape
together with a mapping from the labels to data values.

dia = shapePlusData # centerXY # pad 1.1

shapePlusData = hcat

  , octo [0..7]
  , strutX 2
  , text "Ã—" # fontSizeL 3 <> phantom (square 1 :: D R2)

  where
    a = (arrow' (with & headLength .~ Local 1) 2 <> hrule 2) |||||| strutX 0.4
\end{diagram}

\end{figure}
However, this must be done in a principled way which allows deriving
properties of labelled structures from corresponding properties of
labelled shapes.  This chapter begins with an overview of \term{Kan
  extensions} (\pref{sec:kan-extensions}) and uses them to define
\term{analytic functors} (\pref{sec:analytic-functors}), which provide
the theoretical basis for extending labelled shapes to labelled
structures.  \todo{Continue this description/outline once the rest of
  the chapter shakes out.}

\section{Kan extensions}
\label{sec:kan-extensions}

The definition of analytic functors, given in
\pref{sec:analytic-functors}, makes central use of the notion of a
(left) \term{Kan extension}.  This section defines Kan extensions and
provides some useful intuition for understanding them in this
context. For more details, see \citet{mac1998categories} \todo{insert
  page number/chapter reference}; for
some good intuition with a computational bent, see \citet{hinze2012kan}.

\begin{defn} \label{defn:lan} Given functors $F : \C \to \D$ and $J :
  \C \to \E$, the \term{left Kan extension of $F$ along $J$}, written
  $\lan J F$\footnote{$\lan J F$ is traditionally notated $\Lan_J F$.
    Inspired by the corresponding notion in relational algebra, Roland
    Backhouse suggested the notation $\ran J F$ for the right Kan
    extension of $F$ along $J$, which was adopted by
    \citet{hinze2012kan}.  This notation is a bit more perspicuous
    than the traditional notation $\Ran_J F$, especially with respect
    to the accompanying computation ($\beta$) and reflection ($\eta$)
    laws.  Unfortunately, there is not quite a satisfactory parallel
    in the case of left Kan extensions.  In relational algebra, the
    notations $A / P$ and $P \backslash A$ are used for the right
    adjoints to pre- and post-composition, respectively; whereas we
    want notations for the left and right adjoints of precomposition.
    I nevertheless adopt the notation $\lan J F$ for left Kan
    extensions, and hope this does not cause confusion.}, is a functor
  $\D \to \E$ characterized by the isomorphism
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:lan}
    (\lan{J}{F} \to G) \iso (F \to G \comp J),
  \end{equation}
  natural in $G$. If this exists for all $F$, then we may say even
  more succinctly that the left Kan extension functor $\lan J -$ is
  left adjoint to $- \comp J$, that is, \[ \lan J - \adj - \comp J. \]
\end{defn}

Intuitively, if $J : \C \to \E$ is thought of as an ``embedding'' of
$\C$ into $\E$, then $\lan J F$ can be thought of as a way of
``extending'' the domain of $F$ from $\C$ to $\E$ in a way compatible
with $J$. \[ \xymatrix{\C \ar[dr]^{F} \ar[d]_J \\ \E \ar[r]_{\lan J F}
  & \D } \] If we substitute $\lan J F$ for $G$ in \pref{eq:lan} and
take the image of $\id_{\lan J F}$, we obtain $\eta : F \to (\lan J F)
\comp J$, a natural transformation sending $F$ to the embedding $J$
followed by the extension $\lan J F$. Intuitively, the existence of
$\eta$ guarantees that $\lan J F$ has to ``act like'' $F$ on the image
of $\C$ under $J$. \todo{2-cell picture illustrating $\eta$} Of
course, $\lan J F$ must also be defined and functorial on all of $\E$,
not just on the image of $C$.  These facts together justify thinking
of $\lan J F$ as an ``extension'' of $F$.  Note also that substituting
$G \comp J$ for $F$ in \pref{eq:lan} and taking the image of
$\id_{G\comp J}$ under the inverse yields $\varepsilon : \lan J {(G
  \comp J)} \to G$, which can be thought of as a computation or
reduction rule.

\todo{simple example(s)?}

The above gives an abstract characterization of left Kan extensions;
under suitable conditions we can explicitly construct them.
\begin{prop} \label{prop:Lan-coend}
When $\D$ is cocomplete and \todo{what?}, $\lan J F$ can be
constructed explicitly as a coend:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lan-coend}
  (\lan J F)\ E = \coend{C} (J\ C \to E) \cdot F\ C.
\end{equation}
\end{prop}
As a Haskell type, this construction corresponds to
\begin{spec}
data Lan j f a where
  Lan :: (f c, j c -> a) -> Lan j f a
\end{spec}
Of course, this type is quite a bit less general than the abstract
definition given above---in particular, it instantiates $\C$, $\D$,
and $\E$ all to \Hask.  However, it is still quite useful for gaining
intuition.  Note that |c| is existentially quantified; recall that in
Haskell this corresponds to a coend.  Note also that the copower
(which in general relates two different categories) turns into simple
pairing.

We now turn to a proof of \pref{prop:Lan-coend}.
\begin{proof}
We must show $(\nt {\lan J F} G) \iso (\nt F {G \comp J})$.
\begin{sproof}
  \stmt{\nt {\lan J F} G}
  \reason{\jeq}{definition}
  \stmt{\nt {(\coend{C} (J\ C \to -) \cdot F\ C)} G}
  \reason{\iso}{natural transformations are ends}
  \stmt{\eend{E} \left( \coend{C} (J\ C \to E) \cdot F\ C \right) \to G\ E}
  \reason{\iso}{$(- \to X)$ turns colimits into limits}
  \stmt{\eend{E} \eend{C} \left( (J\ C \to E) \cdot F\ C \to G\ E
    \right)}
  \reason{\iso}{universal property of copowers (generalized
    currying)}
  \stmt{\eend{E} \eend{C} (J\ C \to E) \to (F\ C \to G\ E)}
  \reason{\iso}{Fubini}
  \stmt{\eend{C} \eend{E} (J\ C \to E) \to (F\ C \to G\ E)}
  \reason{\iso}{Yoneda}
  \stmt{\eend{C} F\ C \to G\ (J\ C)}
  \reason{\iso}{natural transformations are ends}
  \stmt{\nt F {G \comp J}}
\end{sproof}
\end{proof}

Instead of merely showing the \emph{existence} of an isomorphism, the
above proof can in fact be interpreted as constructing a specific
isomorphism: each step has some constructive justification, and the
final isomorphism is the composition of all the steps.  However,
instead of formally expounding this isomorphism, it is useful to
instead carry out the construction in Haskell, using the type |Lan|
defined above.  This brings out the essential components of the proof
without getting too bogged down in abstraction.

\begin{spec}
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

lanAdjoint :: Functor g => (forall c. f c -> g (j c)) -> (forall a. Lan j f a -> g a)
lanAdjoint g = homL (uncurry (yoneda' g))
  where
    -- Turn a forall outside an arrow into an existential to the left
    -- of the arrow
    homL :: (forall a c. (f c, j c -> a) -> g a) -> (forall a. Lan j f a -> g a)
    homL h (Lan (fc, jc_a)) = h (fc, jc_a)

    -- One direction of the Yoneda lemma.
    yoneda :: Functor f => f c -> (forall a. (c -> a) -> f a)
    yoneda fc h = fmap h fc

    -- A particular instantiation of the Yoneda lemma.  This needs to
    -- be declared and given a type signature, since there are higher-rank
    -- types involved and GHC is not able to infer them.
    yoneda' :: Functor g => (forall c. f c -> g (j c)) -> (forall c. f c -> (forall a. (j c -> a) -> g a))
    yoneda' h fc = yoneda (h fc)
\end{spec}

\section{Analytic functors}
\label{sec:analytic-functors}

With left Kan extensions under our belts, we're ready to consider
Joyal's definition of \term{analytic
  functors}~\cite{Joyal-analytic-functors}.
\begin{defn}
  Given a species $F \in [\B,\Set]$, the \term{analytic functor} $\hat
  F$ corresponding to $F$ is given by the left Kan extension of $F$
  along the inclusion functor $\iota : \B \inj \Set$. A functor $\Set \to \Set$ is \term{analytic} when it
  arises in this way from some species.
\end{defn}
We can think of $\hat F$ as the polymorphic ``data type'' arising from
the species $F$. The construction in \pref{prop:Lan-coend} tells us
exactly what such a data type looks like: $\hat F\ A = \coend L (\iota
L \to A) \times F\ L$.  That is, given a set $A$, a value in $\hat F\
A$ consists of an $L$-labelled $F$-shape together with a function (\ie
a morphism in $\Set$) from $\iota L$ to $A$.  The coend means that the
choice of a particular label set $L$ does not matter: any two values
$f : (\iota L \to A) \times F\ L$ and $g : (\iota L' \to A) \times F\
L' $ are considered equal if there is some bijection $\sigma : L \bij
L'$ which sends $f$ to $g$.

  Kan extension.  Use Haskell derivation from previous section.}

\todo{Note that $(F \comp \X)\ 0$ yields $\hat F$. --- from Todd
  Trimble's ``notes on the Lie Operad''.}

Analytic functors have many nice properties: for example, they are
closed under \todo{?}, and have corresponding \term{generating
  functions} (indeed, part of the motivation of Joyal's work seems to
have been to categorify the theory of generating functions).

In fact, passing from $\B$ to $\P$ \todo{finish: can see generating
  functions emerge.}

\section{Labelled structures}
\label{sec:labelled-structures}


\section{Generalized labelled structures}
\label{sec:gen-labelled-structures}

However, the above definition of analytic functors is specific to
$[\B,\Set]$.  It must first be modified to apply to the generalized
species from the previous chapter.

\section{Operations on labelled structures}
\label{sec:labelled-operations}

\todo{Edit. Dumped here from description of product from paper.}

%%% XXX remove me
\newcommand{\under}[1]{\floor{#1}}
\newcommand{\lift}[1]{\ceil{#1}}
\newcommand{\lab}[1]{\langle #1 \rangle}
\newcommand{\LStr}[3]{#1 #2 #3}

One introduces a labelled $(F \sprod G)$-shape by pairing a labelled
$F$-shape and a labelled $G$-shape, using a label set isomorphic to
the coproduct of the two label types:
\begin{align*}
  - \sprod_- - &: (\under{L_1} + \under{L_2} \equiv \under{L}) \to F\ L_1
  \to G\ L_2 \to (F \sprod G)\ L \\
  - \lab{\sprod}_- - &: (\under{L_1} + \under{L_2} \equiv \under{L}) \to \LStr F {L_1} A \to \LStr G {L_2} A \to
  \LStr {F \sprod G} L A
\end{align*}
We use here (and for the rest of the paper) the notational convention that
the isomorphism arguments are given first, but are written as subscripts
in mathematical notation.



%% XXX remove me
\newcommand{\StoreNP}{\mapsto}

\todo{Edit. Dumped here from paper.}

As an example, we may now encode the standard algebraic data type of
lists, represented by the inductively-defined species satisfying
$\List \equiv \One + (\X \sprod \List)$ (for convenience, in what
follows we leave implicit the constructor witnessing this
equivalence).  We can then define the usual constructors $\cons{nil}$
and $\cons{cons}$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
  &\cons{nil} : \LStr{\List}{\Fin 0} A \\
  &\cons{nil} \defeq \lab{\inl} \lab{\One} \\
  &\cons{cons} : A \to \LStr \List L A \to (\Fin 1 + \under L \equiv
  \under{L'}) \to \LStr \List {L'} A \\
  &\cons{cons}\ a\ (|shape|,|elts|)\ e \defeq (\inr\ (\cons{x} \sprod_e
  |shape|), |append|\ e\ (|allocate|\ (\lambda x. a))\ |elts|)
\end{align*}
The interesting thing to note here is the extra equivalence passed as
an argument to $\cons{cons}$, specifying the precise way in which the
old label type augmented with an extra distinguished label is
isomorphic to the new label type.  Again, one might intuitively expect
something like \[ \cons{cons} : A \to \LStr \List L A \to \LStr \List
{\lift{\Fin 1} + L} A, \] but this is nonsensical: we cannot take the
coproduct of two elements of $\FinType$, as it is underspecified.  For
implementations of $\StoreNP - -$ which make use of the equivalence to
$\Fin n$ stored in $\FinType$ values (we give an example of one such
implementation in \pref{sec:vecmap}), the extra equivalence given as
an argument to \cons{cons} allows us to influence the particular way
in which the list elements are stored in memory.  For lists, this is
not very interesting, and we would typically use a variant $\cons{cons'}
: A \to \LStr \List L A \to \LStr \List {\cons{inc}(L)} A$ making use of a
canonical construction $\cons{inc}(-) : \FinType \to \FinType$ with
$\Fin 1 + \under L \equiv \under{\cons{inc}(L)}$.

\section{Sharing}
\label{sec:sharing}

That is, multiple parts of the same shape can all ``point to'' the
same data.  In pure functional languages such as Haskell or Agda,
sharing is a (mostly) unobservable operational detail; with a labelled
structure we can directly model and observe
it. \pref{fig:tree-list-cp} illustrates the Cartesian product of a
binary tree and a list.
