\chapter{Labelled structures}
\label{chap:labelled}

\todo{Talk about bag vs rubbish?}

\todo{Fix introduction, given that we have now already discussed
  generating functions}
The original motivation for the theory of species was not to give a
unifying agebraic framework for studying combinatorial structures
\latin{per se}.  Rather, the specific motivation was to provide new
justification and a unifying context for an existing body of
techniques involving \term{generating functions}.

\todo{Continue introduction.}

Now that we have a foundation for describing labelled shapes, the next
step is to extend them into full-blown \emph{data structures} by
adjoining mappings from labels to data.  For example,
\pref{fig:shape-data} illustrates an example of a labelled shape
together with a mapping from the labels to data values.

\end{figure}
However, this must be done in a principled way which allows deriving
properties of labelled structures from corresponding properties of
labelled shapes.  This chapter begins with an overview of \term{Kan
  extensions} (\pref{sec:kan-extensions}) and \term{analytic functors}
(\pref{sec:analytic-functors}), which provide the theoretical basis
for extending labelled shapes to labelled structures.  \todo{Continue

\section{Kan extensions}
\label{sec:kan-extensions}

The definition of analytic functors, given in
\pref{sec:analytic-functors}, makes central use of the notion of a
(left) \term{Kan extension}.  This section defines Kan extensions and
provides some useful intuition for understanding them in this
context. For more details, see \citet[Chapter X]{mac1998categories};
for some good intuition with a computational bent, see
\citet{hinze2012kan}.

\begin{defn} \label{defn:lan} Given functors $F : \C \to \D$ and $J :
  \C \to \E$, the \term{left Kan extension of $F$ along $J$}, written
  $\lan J F$\footnote{$\lan J F$ is traditionally notated $\Lan_J F$.
    Inspired by the corresponding notion in relational algebra, Roland
    Backhouse suggested the notation $\ran J F$ for the right Kan
    extension of $F$ along $J$, which was adopted by
    \citet{hinze2012kan}.  This notation is a bit more perspicuous
    than the traditional notation $\Ran_J F$, especially with respect
    to the accompanying computation ($\beta$) and reflection ($\eta$)
    laws.  Unfortunately, there is not quite a satisfactory parallel
    in the case of left Kan extensions.  In relational algebra, the
    notations $A / P$ and $P \backslash A$ are used for the right
    adjoints to pre- and post-composition, respectively; whereas we
    want notations for the left and right adjoints of precomposition.
    I nevertheless adopt the notation $\lan J F$ for left Kan
    extensions, and hope this does not cause confusion.}, is a functor
  $\E \to \D$ characterized by the isomorphism
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:lan}
    (\nt {\lan{J}{F}} G) \iso (\nt F {G \comp J}),
  \end{equation}
  natural in $G$. (Note that the left-hand side consists of natural
  transformations between functors $\E \to \D$, whereas the right-hand
  side are between functors $\C \to \D$.) If this isomorphism exists
  for all $F$, then we may say even more succinctly that the left Kan
  extension functor $\lan J -$ is left adjoint to the precomposition
  functor $- \comp J$.
\end{defn}

The situation can be pictured as shown below: \[ \xymatrix{\C
  \ar[dr]^{F} \ar[d]_J \\ \E \ar[r]_{\lan J F} & \D } \] Intuitively,
if $J : \C \to \E$ is thought of as an ``embedding'' of $\C$ into
$\E$, then $\lan J F$ can be thought of as a way of ``extending'' the
domain of $F$ from $\C$ to $\E$ in a way compatible with $J$. If we
substitute $\lan J F$ for $G$ in \pref{eq:lan} and take the image of
$\id_{\lan J F}$, we obtain $\eta : F \to (\lan J F) \comp J$, a
natural transformation sending $F$ to the embedding $J$ followed by
the extension $\lan J F$. Intuitively, the existence of $\eta$
guarantees that $\lan J F$ has to ``act like'' $F$ on the image of
$\C$ under $J$. Of course, $\lan J F$ must also be defined and
functorial on all of $\E$, not just on the image of $C$.  These facts
together justify thinking of $\lan J F$ as an ``extension'' of $F$.
Note also that substituting $G \comp J$ for $F$ in \pref{eq:lan} and
taking the image of $\id_{G\comp J}$ under the inverse yields
$\varepsilon : \lan J {(G \comp J)} \to G$, which can be thought of as
a computation or reduction rule.

\later{simple example(s)?}

The above gives an abstract characterization of left Kan extensions;
under suitable conditions we can explicitly construct them.
\begin{prop} \label{prop:Lan-coend}
  When $\D$ has coends over $\C$ and $\C$ has all coproducts, $\lan J
  F$ can be constructed explicitly as a coend:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lan-coend}
  (\lan J F)\ E = \coend{C} (\Hom {J\ C} E) \cdot F\ C.
\end{equation}
Note that $\cdot$ denotes a \term{copower}; in this particular case,
$(J\ C \to E) \cdot F\ C$ denotes an indexed coproduct, \emph{i.e.}
the collection of pairs of a morphism in $(\Hom {J\ C} E)$ and an
object $F\ C$.
\end{prop}
As a Haskell type, this construction corresponds to
\begin{spec}
data Lan j f a where
  Lan :: (f c, j c -> a) -> Lan j f a
\end{spec}
The @kan-extensions@ package~\citep{kmett-kan-extensions}
contains a similar definition. Of course, this type is quite a bit
less general than the abstract definition given above---in particular,
it instantiates $\C$, $\D$, and $\E$ all to \Hask.  However, it is
still quite useful for gaining intuition.  Note that |c| is
existentially quantified; recall that in Haskell this corresponds to a
coend.  Note also that the copower (which in general relates two
different categories) turns into simple pairing.

We now turn to a proof of \pref{prop:Lan-coend}.
\begin{proof}
We must show $(\nt {\lan J F} G) \iso (\nt F {G \comp J})$.
\begin{sproof}
  \stmt{\nt {\lan J F} G}
  \reason{\jeq}{definition}
  \stmt{\nt {(\coend{C} (J\ C \to -) \cdot F\ C)} G}
  \reason{\iso}{natural transformations are ends}
  \stmt{\eend{E} \left( \coend{C} (J\ C \to E) \cdot F\ C \right) \to G\ E}
  \reason{\iso}{$(- \to X)$ turns colimits into limits}
  \stmt{\eend{E} \eend{C} \left( (J\ C \to E) \cdot F\ C \to G\ E
    \right)}
  \reason{\iso}{currying}
  \stmt{\eend{E} \eend{C} (J\ C \to E) \to (F\ C \to G\ E)}
  \reason{\iso}{Yoneda}
  \stmt{\eend{C} F\ C \to G\ (J\ C)}
  \reason{\iso}{natural transformations are ends}
  \stmt{\nt F {G \comp J}}
\end{sproof}
\end{proof}

Instead of merely showing the \emph{existence} of an isomorphism, the
above proof can in fact be interpreted as constructing a specific one:
each step has some constructive justification, and the final
isomorphism is the composition of all the steps.  However, instead of
formally expounding this isomorphism, it is useful to carry out the
construction in Haskell, using the type |Lan| defined above. This
brings out the essential components of the proof without getting too
bogged down in abstraction.  The code corresponding to the backwards
direction of the proof is shown in \pref{fig:lan-coend-Hask} (note
that it requires the |GADTs| and |RankNTypes| extensions~\citep{GADTs,
  RankNTypes}).\footnote{As evidenced by the @kan-extensions@
  package~\citep{kmett-kan-extensions}, the implementation of
  this constructive proof in Haskell can be considerably simplified,
  but at the expense of obscuring the connection to the original
  abstract proof given above.} The code for the forward direction is
similar, and it is the backwards direction which will be of particular
use later.

\section{Analytic functors}
\label{sec:analytic-functors}

\later{Apparently the terminology ``analytic'' is not due to Joyal? See
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_functors}.}

We are now ready to consider Joyal's definition of \term{analytic
  functors}~\citep{joyal86}. Analytic functors, of type $\Set \to
\Set$, are those which arise as left Kan extensions of species.  They
can also intuitively be characterized as those functors $\Set \to
\Set$ which ``have a Taylor expansion''.  This will be made more
precise in \pref{sec:analytic-generating}, although this latter
definition is less useful in a generalized setting.

\subsection{Definition and intuition}
\label{sec:analytic-definition}

\begin{defn}[Joyal]
  Given a species $F : \fc \B \Set$, the \term{analytic functor}
  $\analytic F$ corresponding to $F$ is given by $\lan \iota F$, the
  left Kan extension of $F$ along the inclusion functor $\iota : \B
  \inj \Set$. A functor $\Set \to \Set$ is \term{analytic} when it
  arises in this way from some species.
\end{defn}
\[ \xymatrix{\B
  \ar[dr]^{F} \ar@@{_{(}->}[d]_\iota \\ \Set \ar[r]_{\analytic F} &
  \Set } \]

We can think of $\analytic F$ as the polymorphic ``data type'' arising from
the species $F$. The construction in \pref{prop:Lan-coend} tells us
exactly what such a data type looks like: \[ \analytic F\ A = \coend L (\iota
L \to A) \times F\ L. \]  That is, given a set $A$, a value in $\analytic F\
A$ consists of an $L$-labelled $F$-shape together with a function (\ie
a morphism in $\Set$) from $\iota L$ to $A$.  The coend means that the
choice of a particular label set $L$ does not matter: any two values
$f : (\iota L \to A) \times F\ L$ and $g : (\iota L' \to A) \times F\
L' $ are considered equal if there is some bijection $\sigma : L \bij
L'$ which sends $f$ to $g$.

Moreover, the natural isomorphism \eqref{eq:lan} in this case
becomes \[ (\nt {\analytic F} G) \iso (\nt F {G \iota}), \] that is,
the natural maps (\ie parametrically polymorphic functions) out of
$\analytic F$ are in one-to-one correspondence with species morphisms
out of $F$.  The isomorphism constructed in \pref{fig:lan-coend-Hask}
can give us some insight into the computational content of this
correspondence.  We identify both $\B$ and $\Set$ with
\Hask---formally dubious but close enough for intuition---and thus the
inclusion functor $\iota : \B \to \Set$ becomes the identity.  Let |h
:: forall c. f c -> g c| be an arbitrary natural transformation from
|f| to |g = g . iota|, which should be thought of as a morphism
between species, that is, between functors $\B \to \Set$.
|lanAdjoint| turns such species morphisms into polymorphic functions
(that is, natural transformations between $\Set \to \Set$ functors)
from |Lan iota f a| to |g a|.  In particular, let |Lan (sp,m)| be a
value of type |Lan iota f a|, containing, for some label type |c|, a
shape |sp : f c| and a mapping |m : iota c -> a|.  Then |lanAdjoint h
(Lan (sp,m))| has type |g a|, and we can carry out the following
simplication just by unfolding definitions:
\begin{sproof}
  \stmt{|lanAdjoint h (Lan (sp,m))|}
  \reason{=}{definition of |lanAdjoint|}
  \stmt{|homL (uncurry (yoneda' h)) (Lan (sp,m))|}
  \reason{=}{definition of |homL|}
  \stmt{|uncurry (yoneda' h) (sp,m)|}
  \reason{=}{definition of |uncurry|}
  \stmt{|yoneda' h sp m|}
  \reason{=}{definition of |yoneda'|}
  \stmt{|yoneda (h sp) m|}
  \reason{=}{definition of |yoneda|}
  \stmt{|fmap m (h sp)|.}
\end{sproof}
This can be interpreted as follows: given the species morphism |h| out
of the species $F$, it is turned into a function out of the
corresponding analytic functor $\analytic F$ by applying it to the
underlying shape, and then functorially applying the associated data
mapping.  Note in particular that |lanAdjoint| is an
\emph{isomorphism}, which means that \emph{every} polymorphic function
out of an analytic functor arises in this way.  That is, every
polymorphic function out of $\analytic F\ A$ is ``just a reshaping'': it is
equivalent to a process consisting of splitting $\analytic F\ A$ into a
labelled shape and a mapping from labels to data, followed by a
``reshaping''---an application of some species morphism to the
shape---and concluding with re-combining the new shape with the data
mapping.

Such a reshaping only has access to the labelled shape, and not to the
values of type $A$, so it obviously cannot depend on them. However,
this is not surprising, since this property is already implied by
naturality.  More interesting is the fact that the set of labels must
be finite. This means, intuitively, that functors corresponding to
infinite data structures are not analytic.  It is not possible to
represent all possible natural maps out of an infinite data structure
by natural maps out of structures containing only a finite number of
labels.  This is proved more formally in \pref{sec:analytic-finite}.

Analytic functors have a close connection to the \emph{shapely types}
of \citet{jay-shapely}.  Shapely types essentially correspond to
analytic functors over $\L$-species; shapely types are those which
decompose into a shape and a \emph{list} of data, which can be thought
of as a mapping from a linearly ordered set of labels to data.

Analytic functors have many nice properties: for example, they are
closed under sums, products, composition, and least fixed
points. \todo{cite. Joyal?} \todo{Expand.  Give a bit more
  context/justification.}

\subsection{Analytic functors and generating functions}
\label{sec:analytic-generating}

\citet{joyal86} showed that analytic functors can also be
characterized as those which ``have Taylor expansions'' (in a suitable
sense).  Passing from $\B$ to $\P$, suppose we have a species
$F : \P \to \Set$; then the analytic functor $\analytic F$ is given
by \[ \analytic F\ A = \coend{(n:\N)} (\iota n \to A) \times F\ n, \]
where $\iota : \P \to \Set$ in this case sends the natural number $n$
to the set $\fin n$.  Note that functions $\fin n \to A$ are in
bijection with the $n$-fold product $A^n$, so $\analytic F\ A$ may
equivalently be expressed as \[ \analytic F\ A \iso \coend{(n:\N)} F\ n
\times A^n. \] The coend, in this case, is a quotient by permutations
on $\fin n$, which act on $F\ n \times A^n$ by permuting the elements
of the $n$-fold product.  So each value of the coend is an equivalence
class of $n!$ pairs, one for each possible permutation of $A^n$. We
may therefore suggestively (if informally) write
\[ \analytic F\ A = \sum_{n : \N} F\ n \times \frac{A^n}{n!} \] which
very strongly resembles the exponential generating function associated
to the species $F$, \[ F(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0} ||F\ n|| \times
\frac{x^n}{n!}. \] Of course, the resemblance is no accident! This
gives another glimpse of the sense in which species (and their
associated analytic functors) are said to be a categorification of
such generating functions.

\subsection{Analytic functors and finiteness}
\label{sec:analytic-finite}

\citet{joyal86} also gave yet another characterization of analytic
functors, namely, those which preserve \term{filtered colimits},
\term{cofiltered limits}, and \term{weak pullbacks}.  It is
instructive to use this characterization as a lens to consider some
examples of functors which are \emph{not} analytic.

\begin{defn}
  A \term{filtered} category $\C$ \citep{adamek2002classification} is
  one which ``has all finite cocones'', that is, for any finite
  collection of objects and morphisms in $\C$, there is some object $C
  \in \C$ with morphisms from all the objects in the collection to
  $C$, such that all the relevant triangles commute.

  Equivalently, and more simply, a filtered category is one for which
  \begin{itemize}
  \item there exists at least one object;
  \item any two objects $C_1, C_2 \in \C$ have an ``upper bound'',
    that is, an object $C_3$ with morphisms \[ \Cospan {C_1} {} {C_3}
    {} {C_2}; \]
  \item and finally, any two parallel morphisms $\Parallel {C_1} f g
    {C_2}$ also have an ``upper bound'', that is, another morphism \[
    \xymatrix{C_1 \ar@@<.5ex>[r]^{f} \ar@@<-.5ex>[r]_{g} & C_2
      \ar[r]^h & C_3} \] such that $f \then h = g \then h$.
  \end{itemize}
  These binary upper bound operations on objects and morphisms may be
  used to inductively ``build up'' cocones for arbitrary diagrams in
  $\C$.
\end{defn}

This can be seen as a ``categorification'' of the notion of a
\term{directed set} (also known as a \term{filtered set}), a preorder
in which any two elements have an upper bound.  Categories can be seen
as generalizations of preorders in which multiple morphisms are
allowed between each pair of objects, so the above definition has to
extend the idea of pairwise upper bounds to apply to parallel
morphisms as well as objects; in a preorder there are no parallel
morphisms so this does not come up.

\begin{ex}
  Any category with a terminal object is filtered: the terminal object
  may be taken as the upper bound of any two objects, and the unique
  morphism to the terminal object as the upper bound of any two
  parallel morphisms.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The poset $(\N,\leq)$, considered as a category whose objects are
  natural numbers, with morphisms $m \leq n$, is a filtered
  category. The upper bound of any two objects is their maximum, and
  there are no parallel morphisms to consider.

  \[ \xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & 1 \ar[r] & 2 \ar[r] & 3 \ar[r] & \dots} \]

  Note that filteredness only requires that every \emph{finite}
  collection of objects have an upper bound; in particular, in this example it is
  not true of \emph{infinite} collections of objects.  For example,
  the set of all even numbers has no upper bound in $\N$.
\end{ex}

 \todo{Some example of a filtered category with nontrivial
    parallel morphisms, which is not cocomplete?  See email.}

\begin{ex}
  Consider the category $\FinNSub$ whose objects are finite subsets of
  $\N$ and whose morphisms are inclusion maps.  That is, whenever $S
  \subseteq T$ there is a single morphism $\iota_{ST} : S \to T$
  defined by $\iota_{ST}(s) = s$.  Since this is a nonempty preorder,
  to see that $\FinNSub$ is filtered it suffices to note that any two
  finite sets $S$ and $T$ have $S \union T$ as an upper bound.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Filtered categories can also be seen as a generalization of finitely
  cocomplete categories, \ie categories having all finite colimits.
  In particular, categories having all finite colimits can be
  characterized as those having an initial object, all binary
  coproducts, and all coequalizers: these are exactly parallel to the
  three criteria given above for filtered categories, with an extra
  ``universal property'' corresponding to each (for example, the
  binary coproduct of two objects is an upper bound along with a
  universal property).

  Therefore, any (finitely) cocomplete category is automatically
  filtered: for example, $\Set$, $\Grp$, and $\Vect$.
\end{ex}

Recall that a \term{diagram} in $\C$ is a functor $\I \to \C$ from
some ``index category'' $\I$, which determines the ``shape'' of
diagrams in $\C$.

\begin{defn}
  A \term{filtered diagram} in $\C$ is a functor $\I \to \C$ from a
  filtered index category $\I$.  A \term{filtered colimit} is a
  colimit of a filtered diagram.
\end{defn}

That is, a filtered diagram in $\C$ is a diagram that ``looks like'' a
filtered category ``sitting inside'' $\C$.  A filtered colimit is
then just a normal colimit which happens to be taken over a filtered
diagram.

\begin{ex}
  Let $F : \C \to \C$ be an endofunctor on the category $\C$. Suppose
  $\C$ contains an initial object $0$, and let $!$ denote the unique
  morphism $0 \to C$.  Then consider the diagram \[ \xymatrix{ 0
    \ar[r]^{!} & F 0 \ar[r]^{F !} & F^2 0 \ar[r]^{F^2 !} & F^3 0
    \ar[r] & \dots} \] The colimit of this diagram is the least fixed point
  $\mu F$, and is a filtered colimit since the diagram has the
  filtered poset $(\N, \leq)$ as its index category.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Pushouts are an example of colimits which are \emph{not} filtered,
  since pushouts are colimits over a span $\Span X {} Z {} Y$, which
  is not filtered ($X$ and $Y$ have no upper bound).
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Recall the filtered poset $\FinNSub$ introduced earlier, consisting
  of finite subsets of $\N$ and inclusion maps.  The inclusion functor
  $\FinNSub \inj \Set$ allows viewing $\FinNSub$ as a diagram in
  $\Set$, and we consider the (filtered) colimit of this diagram,
  which must consist of some set $S$ along with maps from all the
  finite subsets of $\N$ into $S$, which commute with the inclusion
  maps among the finite subsets of $\N$.  In fact, it suffices to take
  $\N$ itself, together with the inclusion maps from each finite
  subset of $\N$ into $\N$.  Intuitively, $\N$ arises here as the
  disjoint union of all finite subsets of $\N$, quotiented by the
  relationships induced by all the inclusion maps---which collapses
  the disjointness, resulting in a simple union of all finite subsets.

  To see that this is universal, suppose we have a set $X$ with maps
  $m_S : S \to X$ for each finite $S \subset \N$, such that the $m_S$
  all commute with inclusion maps between the finite subsets of $\N$.
  Define $\theta : \N \to X$ by $\theta(n) = m_{\{n\}}(n)$. We must
  show that the $m_S$ all factor through $\theta$.
  \[ \xymatrix{ S \ar[dr]^{m_S} \ar[d]_{\iota_S} & \{k\} \ar[l]
    \ar[d]^{m_{\{k\}}} \\ \N \ar[r]_\theta & X } \]
  Given some $S
  \subset \N$ and some $k \in S$, we have $\theta(\iota_S(k)) =
  \theta(k) = m_{\{k\}}(k)$; but this is indeed equal to $m_S(k)$,
  since there exists an inclusion map $\{k\} \to S$, and we assumed
  the $m_S$ commute with inclusion maps.
\end{ex}

Now consider the functor $F \defeq (-)^\N : \Set \to \Set$, which
sends the set $A$ to the set $A^\N$ of functions from $\N$ to $A$
\citep{trimble-not-analytic}.  The claim is that $F$ is not analytic,
and in particular that it does not preserve the filtered colimit of
$\FinNSub$, discussed above.  As we will see, the ``problem'' is that
$F$ corresponds to an \emph{infinite} data type, \ie one which can
contain infinitely many $A$ values.  In particular, $F$ corresponds to
the data type of \emph{infinite streams}: a function $\N \to A$ can be
thought of as an infinite stream of $A$ values, where the value of the
function at $n$ gives the value of $A$ located at position $n$ in the
stream.

We also consider how $F$ acts on inclusion maps.  The action of $F$ on
morphisms is given by postcomposition, so $F$ sends the inclusion
$\iota : S \inj T$ to $\iota \comp - : S^\N \to T^\N$, which is also
an inclusion map: it sends the stream $s : \N \to S$ to the stream
$\iota \comp s : \N \to T$, consisting of the application of $\iota$
to every element in $s$.  That is, $\iota \comp -$ does not actually
modify any values of a stream, but simply codifies the observation
that whenever $S \subseteq T$, a stream containing only values from
$S$ may also be thought of as a stream containing only values from $T$
(which simply happens not to include any values from $T - S$).

We saw above that the colimit of $\FinNSub$, considered as a diagram
in $\Set$, is $\N$ (together with the obvious inclusion maps to $\N$
from each finite subset).  $F$ sends $\N$ to $\N^\N$, the type of
infinite streams of natural numbers.  $F$ also sends each inclusion
map $S \inj \N$ to the inclusion $S^\N \inj \N^\N$, which allows a
stream of $S$ values to be ``upgraded'' to a stream of natural
numbers.

Now consider where $F$ sends the diagram $\FinNSub$.  $F$ sends each
finite set $S \subset \N$ to the set of infinite streams of $S$
values, $S^\N$, and it sends each inclusion $S \inj T$ to the
inclusion $S^\N \inj T^\N$.  However, the colimit of this new diagram
$F( \FinNSub)$ is not $\N^\N$, the set of streams of natural numbers,
but instead the set of \emph{finitely supported} streams of natural
numbers, that is, the set of all streams which contain only finitely
many distinct elements.  Thus $F\ (\colim \FinNSub) \ncong \colim (F\
\FinNSub)$, and we conclude that $F$ is not analytic since it does not
preserve filtered colimits.

\later{Give a bit more intuition about this example.}

Another example\footnote{Also due to \citet{trimble-not-analytic}.} is
given by the covariant power set functor $P : \Set \to \Set$, which
sends each set $A$ to its power set $P(A)$, the set of all subsets of
$A$, and sends each function $f : A \to B$ to the function $P(f) :
P(A) \to P(B)$ which gives the image of a subset of $A$ under $f$.
$P(\N)$ is the set of all (finite and infinite) subsets of $\N$, but
$\colim P(\FinNSub)$ is the set of all \emph{finite} subsets of $\N$.
Note, however, that the covariant finite powerset functor $FP : \Set
\to \Set$, which sends each set $A$ to the set of all its
\emph{finite} subsets, is analytic; it corresponds to the species
$\Bag^2$.

\subsection{Generalized analytic functors}
\label{sec:gen-analytic-functors}

In general, suppose we have a functor $F : \Lab \to \Str$, as well as
a functor $\iota : \Lab \to \Str$.  We can define \[ \analytic F
\defeq \coend L (\hom{\iota\ L}{A}) \cdot F\ L \] as long as
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Str$ is copowered over $\Set$, \ie has all coproducts, and
\item $\Str$ has coends over $\Lab$.
\end{itemize}

As a particular example, the definition of analytic functors ports
almost unchanged into homotopy type theory: we merely replace the
set-theoretic categories $\B$ and $\Set$ with the homotopy-theoretic
$\BT$ and $\ST$, respectively, yielding \[ \analytic F\ A = \coend L
(\hom[\ST] {\iota\ L} A) \times F\ L, \] where $\iota : \B \to \S$ is
the evident injection which acts on morphisms via transport.
Recalling that coends in HoTT are just $\Sigma$-types, and that
morphisms in $\ST$ are functions, we have \[ \analytic F\ A = \sum_{L
  : \BT} (\iota\ L \to A) \times F\ L. \]

\section{Labelled structures}
\label{sec:labelled-structures}

$\analytic F$ thus represents the ``data type'' corresponding to the
species $F$, whose values consist of a labelled $F$-shape paired with
a map assigning a data value to each label.  It will be convenient,
however, to be able to explicitly work with label types.

\subsection{Simple labelled structures}
\label{sec:simple-labelled}

\begin{defn}
  Given a species $F$, the type of \term{labelled structures} over $F$
  is a bifunctor $\lab F : \B \times \Set \to \Set$,
  defined by \[ \LStr F L A = (\iota L \to A) \times F\ L. \]
\end{defn}

We evidently have $\analytic F\ A = \coend L \LStr F L A$, that is,
labelled structures are obtained from analytic functors by ``taking
the coend off'', exposing the set of labels as a parameter.
$\LStr F L -$ is clearly functorial.  Note, however, that $L$ appears
both co- and contravariantly, so $\LStr F - A$ is functorial only if
$\Lab$ is a groupoid, in which case $\LStr F \sigma A = (\iota
(\sigma^{-1}) \to A) \times F \sigma$.

Note that the same definition applies equally well in HoTT, replacing
$\B$ and $\Set$ with $\BT$ and $\ST$.

\subsection{Generalized labelled structures}
\label{sec:generalized-labelled}

To generalize labelled structures to $(\fc \Lab \Str)$-species where
$\Lab$ is not a groupoid, we must split the parameter $L$ into two,
one each for the contravariant and covariant occurrences: \[ \GLStr F
K L A \defeq (\iota K \to A) \times F\ L. \]

\subsection{An attempt at generalized functor composition}
\label{sec:gen-functor-composition}

Recall from \pref{sec:functor-composition} that if species are taken
to be functors $\B \to \B$, then one can define the \term{functor
  composition} $G \fcomp F$ to be the literal composition of $G$ and
$F$, that is, $(G \fcomp F)\ L = G\ (F\ L)$.  However, if species are
taken as functors $\B \to \Set$ it is not clear how to generalize this
idea.  Given the idea of analytic functors, we are ready to consider
one possible idea---which unfortunately does not work.

It seems we must begin by restricting ourselves to functors $F, G : \B
\to \FinSet$; we cannot use infinite sets of shapes as label sets.  In
that case, as observed previously, functors $\B \to \FinSet$ are
essentially equivalent to functors $\B \to \B$, so in fact defining
functor composition for species $\B \to \FinSet$ is not difficult.
However, it still does not give us any idea of how to generalize to
$(\Lab,\Str)$-species.

There is another possibility: given some embedding functor $\iota :
\Lab \to \Str$ (with some mild restrictions), there is a monoidal
structure on $\fc \Lab \Str$, given by $G \bullet F = F \comp (\lan
\iota G)$, that is, \[ \xymatrix{ & \Lab \ar[d]^\iota \ar[dr]^G \\
  \Lab \ar[r]_F & \Str \ar[r]_{\lan \iota G} & \Str } \]
\citep{altenkirch2010monads}.  Unfortunately, if we examine the
special case of $\B \to \FinSet$, we can see that this monoidal
structure is \emph{not} the same as functor composition.  To see the
difference, suppose $G : \B \to \FinSet$ is some species all of whose
shapes contain each label exactly once.  Note that $\lan \iota G$ is
by definition $\analytic G$, the analytic functor corresponding to
$G$.  Therefore, $(\analytic G \comp F)$-shapes on $L$ consist of
$G$-structures containing $(F\ L)$-shapes as data.  Note that any
particular $(F\ L)$-shape can occur multiple times or none at all.  In
contrast, a $(G \fcomp F)$-shape contains every possible $F$-shape
exactly once.

\section{Operations on labelled structures}
\label{sec:labelled-operations}

\todo{Edit. Dumped here from description of product from paper.}

%%% XXX remove me
\newcommand{\under}[1]{\floor{#1}}
\newcommand{\lift}[1]{\ceil{#1}}

One introduces a labelled $(F \sprod G)$-shape by pairing a labelled
$F$-shape and a labelled $G$-shape, using a label set isomorphic to
the coproduct of the two label types:
\begin{align*}
  - \sprod_- - &: (\under{L_1} + \under{L_2} \equiv \under{L}) \to F\ L_1
  \to G\ L_2 \to (F \sprod G)\ L \\
  - \lab{\sprod}_- - &: (\under{L_1} + \under{L_2} \equiv \under{L}) \to \LStr F {L_1} A \to \LStr G {L_2} A \to
  \LStr {F \sprod G} L A
\end{align*}
We use here (and for the rest of the paper) the notational convention that
the isomorphism arguments are given first, but are written as subscripts
in mathematical notation.



%% XXX remove me
\newcommand{\StoreNP}{\mapsto}

\todo{Edit. Dumped here from paper.}

As an example, we may now encode the standard algebraic data type of
lists, represented by the inductively-defined species satisfying
$\List \equiv \One + (\X \sprod \List)$ (for convenience, in what
follows we leave implicit the constructor witnessing this
equivalence).  We can then define the usual constructors $\cons{nil}$
and $\cons{cons}$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
  &\cons{nil} : \LStr{\List}{\Fin 0} A \\
  &\cons{nil} \defeq \lab{\inl} \lab{\One} \\
  &\cons{cons} : A \to \LStr \List L A \to (\Fin 1 + \under L \equiv
  \under{L'}) \to \LStr \List {L'} A \\
  &\cons{cons}\ a\ (|shape|,|elts|)\ e \defeq (\inr\ (\cons{x} \sprod_e
  |shape|), |append|\ e\ (|allocate|\ (\lambda x. a))\ |elts|)
\end{align*}
The interesting thing to note here is the extra equivalence passed as
an argument to $\cons{cons}$, specifying the precise way in which the
old label type augmented with an extra distinguished label is
isomorphic to the new label type.  Again, one might intuitively expect
something like \[ \cons{cons} : A \to \LStr \List L A \to \LStr \List
{\lift{\Fin 1} + L} A, \] but this is nonsensical: we cannot take the
coproduct of two elements of $\FinType$, as it is underspecified.  For
implementations of $\StoreNP - -$ which make use of the equivalence to
$\Fin n$ stored in $\FinType$ values (we give an example of one such
implementation in \pref{sec:vecmap}), the extra equivalence given as
an argument to \cons{cons} allows us to influence the particular way
in which the list elements are stored in memory.  For lists, this is
not very interesting, and we would typically use a variant $\cons{cons'}
: A \to \LStr \List L A \to \LStr \List {\cons{inc}(L)} A$ making use of a
canonical construction $\cons{inc}(-) : \FinType \to \FinType$ with
$\Fin 1 + \under L \equiv \under{\cons{inc}(L)}$.

\section{Eliminators for labelled structures}
\label{sec:elim-labelled}

\todo{Note that everything applies equally to $\fc \B \Set$ or to $\fc
  \BT \ST$.}
We have see how to \emph{construct} values of the type $\analytic F\
A$ for various $F$; we now consider how to \emph{eliminate} them.  In
particular, consider a function of type $\analytic F\ A \to B$, for
some arbitrary set (type) $B$.  We compute as follows:
\begin{sproof}
  \stmt{\analytic F\ A \to B}
  \reason{=}{definition}
  \stmt{(\coend L F\ L \times (\iota\ L \to A)) \to B}
  \reason{\iso}{$(- \to B)$ turns colimits into limits}
  \stmt{\eend L (F\ L \times (\iota\ L \to A)) \to B}
  \reason{\iso}{currying}
  \stmt{\eend L F\ L \to ((\iota L \to A) \to B)}
  \reason{\iso}{ends are natural transformations}
  \stmt{\nt F ((\iota\ - \to A) \to B)}
\end{sproof}

Note that $((\iota\ - \to A) \to B)$ is a functor of type $\B \to
\Set$, that is, a species, \todo{Add it as an example earlier?} which
we will abbreviate $B^{A^-}$.  Hence the above derivation amounts to
saying that a function $(\analytic F\ A \to B)$ eliminating an
analytic functor is equivalent to a species morphism $F \to B^{A^-}$.
We can therefore leverage the \todo{stuff from previous chapter}.

\todo{go through some examples.}
