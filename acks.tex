A big thank you is due to Beeminder (\url{http://beeminder.com}),
particularly to the Beeminder cofounders, Bethany Soule and Danny
Reeves.  There is absolutely no chance I would have finished this
dissertation without Beeminder; I owe the whole beeminder team a round
of beers!

I am thankful to all who answered questions or otherwise lent their
expertise to this work.  Ross Street generously answered some
questions via email and indirectly led me down a path that resulted in
a good deal of the content of \pref{chap:equality}.  Another helpful
impetus along the same path was a MathOverflow
answer\footnote{\url{http://mathoverflow.net/questions/164753/generalizing-indexed-coproduct-from-mathrmset-to-other-monoidal-categories}}
from Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine.

The \texttt{diagrams} community---particularly Daniel Bergey, Jeff
Rosenbluth, Michael Sloan, Luite Stegeman, and Ryan Yates---has been a
great source of joy to me during the long process of completing a PhD.
Not only have they provided encouragement, camraderie, and welcome
distraction, but this dissertation itself is richer for their
contributions to \texttt{diagrams}---many of the diagrams throughout
this document make nontrivial use of features contributed by other
members of the community.  It has also been a particular joy to see
the project continue humming along even during my virtual absence
while writing.

I am grateful to all who read early drafts and sent me typo reports as
well as more substantial suggestions, all of which greatly improved
the final product: David Roberts, Toby Bartels, Colin McQuillan, Ryan
Yates, Gabor Greif, Derek Elkins, Jon Sterling, Jay McCarthy, and
Heinrich Apfelmus.

I have, both directly and indirectly, benefited over the years from
conversations with many people in the Haskell community and the wider
FP and PL communities, including Faris Abou-Saleh, Reid Barton,
Gershom Bazerman, Conal Elliott, Jeremy Gibbons, Jason Gross, Ralf
Hinze, Neel Krishnaswami, Dan Licata, Simon Peyton Jones, Andrea
Vezzosi, and Nick Wu, along with many others.

A heartfelt thank you to the Williams computer science department for
the genuine care and support I have received as a visiting faculty
member, and especially to Bill Lenhart for his generous gift of time
in taking on most of the grungy legwork for CS 134.  Beginning a new
job, teaching two classes, and simultaneously completing a
dissertation would be impossible even to contemplate were it not for
such a supportive environment.

The Green Line Cafe, Lovers \& Madmen, the Penn graduate student
center, Van Pelt library, Tunnel City Coffee, and Williams' Schow
science library have all provided wonderfully conducive environments
for long writing sessions.
