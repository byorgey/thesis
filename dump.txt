\subsection{Species isomorphism}
\label{sec:species-iso}

We have now seen four primitive species: \Zero, \One, \X, and \E.  It
turns out that each of them is the unit for a different monoid
structure on species; we will look at each of these in turn, as well
as an additional fifth monoid structure.  Before we get there,
however, we need to take a brief detour to discuss isomorphism of
species, since the monoid laws hold only up to isomorphism.

Since species are functors, a \term{morphism} between species $F$ and
$G$ is a natural transformation, that is, a transformation from
$F$-shapes to $G$-shapes which works uniformly for all label
types. Formally, the type of species morphisms is given by
\begin{align*}
  &- \mor - : \Species \to \Species \to \Type \\
  &F \mor G = (\varphi : \impl{L : \FinType} \to F\ L \to G\ L)
  \times \Natural\ \varphi
\end{align*}
where $\Natural\ \varphi$ is the proposition which states that $\varphi$ is
\term{natural}, that is, the diagram shown in
\pref{fig:species-morphism} commutes for all $L, L' : \FinType$ and
all $\sigma : L \iso L'$.

      F\ L \ar[d]_{\varphi_L} \ar[r]^{F\ \sigma} & F\ L' \ar[d]^{\varphi_{L'}} \\
      G\ L                    \ar[r]_{G\ \sigma} & G\ L'
    }
  }
  \caption{Naturality for species morphisms}

\end{figure}
Intuitively, $\varphi$ is natural if it does not depend on the type of
the labels, that is, it acts uniformly for all choices of label set:
it does not matter whether one first relabels an $F$-shape and then
applies $\varphi$, or applies $\varphi$ first and later relabels.

An \term{isomorphism} between species, denoted $F \natiso G$, is just
a pair of inverse morphisms, that is, $\varphi : F \mor G$ and
$\varphi^{-1} : G \mor F$ such that $\varphi^{-1}_L \comp \varphi_L =
id_{FL}$ and $\varphi_L \comp \varphi^{-1}_L = id_{GL}$ for all $L :
\FinType$.  Species isomorphism preserves all the interesting
\emph{combinatorial} properties of species; hence in the combinatorics
literature everything is always implicitly done up to
isomorphism. However, species isomorphisms carry computational
content, so when dealing with labelled structures we must be more
careful and explicit in their use.

It is worth noting that an inverse pair of ``bare'' morphisms, without
naturality, constitute what is termed an \term{equipotence} between
two species.  An equipotence preserves the \emph{number} of shapes of
each size, but it does not necessarily preserve the structure of those
shapes. As a classic example, the species of \emph{lists} and the
species of \emph{permutations} are equipotent but not isomorphic:
there are the same number of lists as permutations of $n$ labels
(namely, $n!$), but there is no way to set up an isomorphism between
them which is uniform over the labels: any such isomorphism
necessarily depends on a linear ordering of the labels.  In a sense,
permutations have ``more structure'' than lists, and this extra
structure cannot be preserved by an isomorphism.  In any case,
although equipotences are of interest to combinatorialists, so far
they do not seem to be of much use computationally, so we will not
consider them further in this paper.
